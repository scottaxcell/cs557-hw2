=================
Program: fsniffer 
=================
* A simple flow sniffer roughly modeled after the argus tool.


======
Usage:
======
$ ./fsniffer [-r filename] [-i interface] [-t time] [-o time_offset] [-N num] [-S secs]

==========================
Building on DETER machines
==========================
To build on DETER machines g++48 needs to be used instead of the regular g++ command.
Running 'make deter' instead of 'make all' on a DETER machine will fix this issue.


======================================
Generate same output using argus tool:
======================================
$ argus -r opensafety_udp_trace.pcap -w output.argus
$ ra -r output.argus -s stime proto saddr sport dir daddr dport pkts bytes state dur

Notes:
======
* I have corrected my misunderstaning of the time_offset and have implemented
  it correctly this time around.
* When I compare the output of fsniffer to argus output I can tell that fsniffer
  is working as expected. The output is not identical because it looks like
  argus is using different mechanism for diviing up flows. Other than this 
  discrepancy, it is still possible to verify that the captured information is
  the same just the output is slightly different and requires some work to verify.
* Overall, it appears the fsniffer program is working as expected.
